# üõçÔ∏è Product Showcase App ‚Äî Frontend

This is the frontend of the **Product Showcase** app built using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**. It interacts with a custom Express.js backend (proxying the DummyJSON API) to display products with rich animations, sorting, pagination, and more.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anshultiwari95/Product-Showcase-Frontend.git
cd Product-Showcase-Frontend

2. Install Dependencies
npm install

3.Update Backend URL
Edit the file components/lib/api.js and replace the base URL with:
const BASE_URL = "https://product-showcase-backend.onrender.com/api";

4.Start Development Server
npm run dev


5.Design Choices & Trade-offs
Chose Framer Motion over GSAP for smoother integration with React and for layoutId-based shared transitions.

For sorting, the backend fetches all products first, sorts them in memory, and then paginates ‚Äî ensuring consistent results across all items. This approach sacrifices performance slightly for accuracy and better UX.

Implemented in-memory caching in backend to avoid redundant calls to DummyJSON API.

Used Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach and faster UI development.

6.Third-party Libraries Used

Library	      Purpose
Framer        Motion	Animations, shared transitions, micro-interactions
Axios	      API requests
TailwindCSS	  Responsive, utility-first styling

7.Bonus Features Implemented
A. Advanced Animation Showcase

Shared element transitions using layoutId (product list ‚Üí detail view)

spring-based transitions for hover and tap animations

Swipe and keyboard support for image carousel

Scroll-triggered entrance animations using useInView

Tab transitions and button interactions with motion effects

Thumbnail hover zoom and selection border indicator

B.In-Memory Caching

Product list (with sorting & categories) is cached on the backend for 5 minutes

Categories also cached to reduce redundant fetches

C. Consistent Sorting with Pagination

Sorting by price (low to high / high to low) works across all items

Even when paginated or filtered by category
